# CEN3031 Final Project 
## Important Reminders
1. Constantly check the [Notes](./Notes) to find the TODO list and other related notes 
2. NEVER push to the master branch on main repository directly. Instead, go through the Following workflow EVERY TIME you want to add something to the main repository: Fork->Clone->Edit->Commit->Pull->Push->Pull Request
3. Test Driven Development (incremental changes and test it with test cases)
4. Document everything
5. Ask questions if you don't know something.
